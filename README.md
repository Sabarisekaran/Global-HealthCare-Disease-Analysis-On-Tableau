Global Healthcare Disease Analysis  Overview



The Global Healthcare Disease Analysis project aims to analyze and provide insights into the trends and patterns of global diseases. By leveraging large datasets and advanced analytics, this project highlights disease prevalence, mortality rates, healthcare infrastructure, and intervention outcomes across different regions of the world. The goal is to foster better healthcare policy decisions, resource allocation, and ultimately contribute to the global fight against diseases.

Features
Disease Prevalence Analysis: Track the occurrence of diseases like COVID-19, malaria, tuberculosis, cancer, and others across various regions.

Mortality Rate Insights: Analyze the mortality rates for different diseases globally and regionally.

Healthcare Infrastructure Analysis: Evaluate the availability and quality of healthcare services across different countries.

Trends over Time: Visualize disease trends and changes in incidence and mortality rates over time.

Intervention Impact: Measure the impact of various healthcare interventions such as vaccination, treatment programs, and public health policies.

Data Sources
World Health Organization (WHO): Disease statistics, global health data.

Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx): A collection of health statistics and disease datasets.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Disease control and prevention reports.

Local Government Health Reports: Country-specific health data for finer granularity.

Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and machine learning tasks.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.

Tableau: For creating detailed, interactive dashboards.

SQL: For database management and querying large datasets.

Data Analysis Approach
Data Cleaning: Remove any inconsistencies or missing values from the dataset to ensure high-quality analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use statistical and visual techniques to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers in the data.

Predictive Modeling: Apply machine learning models to forecast disease trends and predict future outbreaks or healthcare needs.

Visualization: Create charts, maps, and interactive dashboards to visualize the findings in a user-friendly format.
